Over three days I made 2 loaves with different combinations of ingredients.  I have no idea how they would turn out because I only googled it long enough to know that there was a chance it would produce a beautiful bread and there's also a chance the enzymes in dairy would degrade the gluten structure.  I'm not really trying to prove any theory correct or not, I just want to find our first hand how they would turn out.</span></p><p><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first loaf I did make had 5 varieties of flour in it, which I know is a lot.  They were on sale and now I’m going nuts with my combinations.

As you may have guessed already, the way I kicked off this experiment was not ideal. When you are doing an experiment, you should change one variable, not every possible variable. What I should have done is made bread with the same grain mix that I’m used to working with in the same hydration level that I know. Instead, I jumped into this and changed up everything possible. Five kinds of flour? No. Don’t do experiments this way. The first loaf was by no means a disappointment for me, it was just too much going on for me to be able to tell what differences in the final result were triggered by which variable.  Was the crumb tight because of the grains or because of the milk?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s talk about how dairy made things different. First off, the hydration felt way off. It felt dryer than what dough of the same hydration felt like with water. With the first loaf, I thought it was possibly because some of the grains absorbed differently than I’m used to, but I do not think that’s the case as the second loaf also felt dryer than I expected. I suppose I really should do one more dairy test and use only bread flour and see how that one feels. I’ll keep you all posted on that.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hydration was not the only thing that felt different. There was a different texture to this bread. It was tender and had a tight crumb. The enzymes in the dairy did degrate the gluten in my dough, but not necessarily in a bad way. The texture was pleasant, still felt like bread, but lost some of the chewiness.  </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The flavors of both loaves were sweeter than I am used to. It was subtle, but noticeable. Neither the milk nor the buttermilk left behind any scent once they were baked.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All in all, I have to be honest and say, I’m not sure I’d make bread with milk very often. There’s nothing wrong with this bread at all, and I’m sure someone reading this will absolutely love the way these loafs came out, but personally, I missed the chewy texture. Midway though this past week I found myself lusting after other people's breads on instagram. I wanted something with more texture than I had. Still, I’m pretty sure I;m going to make at least one other loaf with milk in it in the near future.</span></p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on February 10, 2019</div><div class="post__footer__col"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://www.sourdoughbake.com/blog/beginner/">beginner</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev">Previous Post<h5><a href="https://www.sourdoughbake.com/blog/bakers-math.html" class="inverse" rel="prev">Baker&#x27;s Math</a></h5></div></nav><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://www.sourdoughbake.com/blog/authors/kristen/" class="inverse" title="Kristen">Kristen</a></h3><p>Kristen is a sweet, helpful lady you can find on instagram as @the_dough_eyed_girl</p></div></div><div class="post__related"><h3 class="u-h5">Related posts</h3><div class="post__related__wrap"><figure><a href="https://www.sourdoughbake.com/blog/bakers-math.html"><img class="lazyload" src="https://www.sourdoughbake.com/blog/media/posts/1/responsive/pexels-photo-564883-xs.jpeg" data-srcset="https://www.sourdoughbake.com/blog/media/posts/1/responsive/pexels-photo-564883-xs.jpeg" data-expand="300" alt="A baker looking at loafs in window pane"></a><figcaption><h4><a href="https://www.sourdoughbake.com/blog/bakers-math.html" class="inverse">Baker&#x27;s Math</a></h4><time datetime="2019-02-03T20:12">February 3, 2019</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii, stitched together by <a href="https://www.talescript.com" title="Websites promote you 24/7.
