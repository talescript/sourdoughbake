I suggested that we could give sourdough a go. I'm an ex chef and we like to teach the kids how to cook. I thought lets not just do it with commercial yeast but the traditional way. So that morning we peeled a potato, mixed some flour and water with the potato peels and then we waited.

Learning the different techniques that make a dough into a round, or an oval and working with high hydration doughs. We struggled a lot at the start. Grace was the one who was more delicate and I'd watch her shape beautiful round loaves and I had flat ones. It took awhile to work it out but she was less rough with the dough. I tended to rush it thinking it had to be done quick and I always knocked the air out of them. We are both much faster now but we have learnt good techniques that get the results.</span></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1d532ll7n8\" ><span class=\" author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovvz79zxz86z1z88zbz79z9z79zpz70zz65zaz71zz66zdz77zsz87z6ncz83zz90zoyjgz71zd\">What is your personal style with regards to making sourdough bread?</span></h2>\n</div>\n<div><span class=\" author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovvz79zxz86z1z88zbz79z9z79zpz70zz65zaz71zz66zdz77zsz87z6ncz83zz90zoyjgz71zd\">We are still pretty new to it all so we try to keep to one or two recipes and get to know them well.

Good bread is not cheap. It’s also harder to find than it should be. So last year I started getting back into baking more, and along with that came pizzas, sticky buns, and bread. The more I baked, the more I was on Instagram looking at what other bakers were doing.  I got really interested in trying my hand at it. I was inspired by what I saw online. The crumb shots, and the scoring, and all the words that I had no idea what they meant, it fueled me to keep diving deeper. </span></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><span class=\"ace-all-bold-hthree\"><span class=\" author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovvz79zxz86z1z88zbz79z9z79zpz70zz65zaz71zz66zdz77zsz87z6ncz83zz90zoyjgz71zd\"><strong>How long have you been making bread, and specifically sourdough bread?  </strong></span></span></div>\n<div><span class=\" author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovvz79zxz86z1z88zbz79z9z79zpz70zz65zaz71zz66zdz77zsz87z6ncz83zz90zoyjgz71zd\">I made my first loaf of sourdough bread towards the end of 2018. It was very recent. I grew up with a mom who used to bake with me often. We made a few different kinds of breads with some regularity. We also used to make pizza when I was a kid from scratch a lot.</span></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><span class=\"ace-all-bold-hthree\"><span class=\" author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovvz79zxz86z1z88zbz79z9z79zpz70zz65zaz71zz66zdz77zsz87z6ncz83zz90zoyjgz71zd\"><strong>What has been the hardest part of learning how to make sourdough for you? </strong></span></span></div>\n<div><span class=\" author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovvz79zxz86z1z88zbz79z9z79zpz70zz65zaz71zz66zdz77zsz87z6ncz83zz90zoyjgz71zd\">Getting my starter to bloom in winter. I’m not really used to failing in the kitchen, but my first starter failed miserably. I’m not even going to lie, I was pretty annoyed about it. The problem I think was I complicated it. I kept seeing people making starters with apple juice or pineapple juice or kombucha. Guess what, that did not work for me at all. So, I stalked to bunch of bakers online and noticed most of them simply used water and flour and that worked out just fine. So my second attempt was 50/50 mix of flour and water and 11 days later, one thermal sock turned sourdough sleeping bag later, I had a live and active sourdough starter and was making my first loaf of bread. </span></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><span class=\"ace-all-bold-hthree\"><span class=\" author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovvz79zxz86z1z88zbz79z9z79zpz70zz65zaz71zz66zdz77zsz87z6ncz83zz90zoyjgz71zd\"><strong>What is your personal style with regards to making sourdough bread? </strong></span></span></div>\n<div><span class=\" author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovvz79zxz86z1z88zbz79z9z79zpz70zz65zaz71zz66zdz77zsz87z6ncz83zz90zoyjgz71zd\">My style is still a little bit all over the place I think, but I guess we could call it experimental.  Because I’m still new to sourdough, I’m trying to improve so many skills and techniques, while simultaneously trying to experiment with many ingredients and flavor combinations in my head.</span></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><span class=\"ace-all-bold-hthree\"><span class=\" author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovvz79zxz86z1z88zbz79z9z79zpz70zz65zaz71zz66zdz77zsz87z6ncz83zz90zoyjgz71zd\"><strong>What’s your routine for refreshing and maintaining your starter? </strong></span></span></div>\n<div><span class=\" author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovvz79zxz86z1z88zbz79z9z79zpz70zz65zaz71zz66zdz77zsz87z6ncz83zz90zoyjgz71zd\">I feed my starter daily a mix 50/50 mix of water and flour. I use King Arthur All Purpose flour and their whole wheat flour in an even mix. I don’t keep a large amount of starter on hand. I’ve read many times over that 250 grams is the magic volume of starter to keep on hand that will live a long and happy life, but for now at least, I keep about 70 to 90 grams total. During the week I feed my starter once a day 30 grams of flour and 30 grams of water, but when I’m going to be making bread the next day I do a morning and a night time feeding. I also have not yet tried putting my starter in the refrigerator, but I do plan to move to that model in the next month or so. </span></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><span class=\"ace-all-bold-hthree\"><span class=\" author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovvz79zxz86z1z88zbz79z9z79zpz70zz65zaz71zz66zdz77zsz87z6ncz83zz90zoyjgz71zd\"><strong>How soon before mixing your dough do you start your autolyse?</strong></span></span></div>\n<div><span class=\" author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovvz79zxz86z1z88zbz79z9z79zpz70zz65zaz71zz66zdz77zsz87z6ncz83zz90zoyjgz71zd\">I don’t think I’m ever consistent with this. My first loaf of bread was a 30 minute autolyse and the bread I started today was a 4 hour autolyse. I do try to do them for about 2 hours or more because I’m always shocked and impressed at the amount of gluten that developed. </span></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><span class=\"ace-all-bold-hthree\"><span class=\" author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovvz79zxz86z1z88zbz79z9z79zpz70zz65zaz71zz66zdz77zsz87z6ncz83zz90zoyjgz71zd\"><strong>What is your favorite grain to work with?  </strong></span></span></div>\n<div><span class=\" author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovvz79zxz86z1z88zbz79z9z79zpz70zz65zaz71zz66zdz77zsz87z6ncz83zz90zoyjgz71zd\">I guess I’d have to say rye, but I don’t feel like I’ve tried enough kinds of wheat yet to be able to properly answer this. </span></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><span class=\"ace-all-bold-hthree\"><span class=\" author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovvz79zxz86z1z88zbz79z9z79zpz70zz65zaz71zz66zdz77zsz87z6ncz83zz90zoyjgz71zd\"><strong>What is your preferred technique for developing gluten in your dough once it’s mixed together? </strong></span></span></div>\n<div><span class=\" author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovvz79zxz86z1z88zbz79z9z79zpz70zz65zaz71zz66zdz77zsz87z6ncz83zz90zoyjgz71zd\">My favorite may be coil folds, simply because I like the way the dough looks when I’m doing it. I think it makes a little dough butt and it makes me giggle every time like a child. Coil folds only work for me with higher hydration doughs, so if I’m working with a lower hydration dough, I do basic stretch and folds. </span></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><span class=\" author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovvz79zxz86z1z88zbz79z9z79zpz70zz65zaz71zz66zdz77zsz87z6ncz83zz90zoyjgz71zd\">Once I finish mixing the autolyse, starter and salt together, I do my first set of coil folds or stretch and folds about a half hour later. I repeat this again about 30 minutes later, then again for the third time about 45 minutes after, and the last set I do about an hour after that. </span></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><span class=\"ace-all-bold-hthree\"><span class=\" author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovvz79zxz86z1z88zbz79z9z79zpz70zz65zaz71zz66zdz77zsz87z6ncz83zz90zoyjgz71zd\"><strong>Do you prefer the ambient or retarded method of baking? </strong></span></span></div>\n<div><span class=\" author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovvz79zxz86z1z88zbz79z9z79zpz70zz65zaz71zz66zdz77zsz87z6ncz83zz90zoyjgz71zd\">I have not actually tried the ambient method of baking.

Don’t focus on your crust, crumb or scoring and don’t compare you bread to that which you see on Instagram. When you do your first bake, find ONE single guide and follow it. If you watch 9 hours of videos on how to make a loaf of bread and then you try to combine all the things you saw, you are likely going to feel frustrated when your bread does not turn out like you expect. Find one guide who you like and mimic what they do. Learn in increments and explore on your own terms. Ultimately, remember the thing that makes a successful loaf of bread is that you enjoy eating it.</span></div>\n<div> </div>",

As you may have guessed already, the way I kicked off this experiment was not ideal. When you are doing an experiment, you should change one variable, not every possible variable. What I should have done is made bread with the same grain mix that I’m used to working with in the same hydration level that I know. Instead, I jumped into this and changed up everything possible. Five kinds of flour? No. Don’t do experiments this way. The first loaf was by no means a disappointment for me, it was just too much going on for me to be able to tell what differences in the final result were triggered by which variable.  Was the crumb tight because of the grains or because of the milk?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s talk about how dairy made things different. First off, the hydration felt way off. It felt dryer than what dough of the same hydration felt like with water. With the first loaf, I thought it was possibly because some of the grains absorbed differently than I’m used to, but I do not think that’s the case as the second loaf also felt dryer than I expected. I suppose I really should do one more dairy test and use only bread flour and see how that one feels. I’ll keep you all posted on that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hydration was not the only thing that felt different. There was a different texture to this bread. It was tender and had a tight crumb. The enzymes in the dairy did degrate the gluten in my dough, but not necessarily in a bad way. The texture was pleasant, still felt like bread, but lost some of the chewiness.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The flavors of both loaves were sweeter than I am used to. It was subtle, but noticeable. Neither the milk nor the buttermilk left behind any scent once they were baked. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All in all, I have to be honest and say, I’m not sure I’d make bread with milk very often. There’s nothing wrong with this bread at all, and I’m sure someone reading this will absolutely love the way these loafs came out, but personally, I missed the chewy texture. Midway though this past week I found myself lusting after other people's breads on instagram. I wanted something with more texture than I had. Still, I’m pretty sure I;m going to make at least one other loaf with milk in it in the near future. </span></p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Baker’s math.<br><br><img class=\"post__image--left\" src=\"https://www.sourdoughbake.com/blog/media/posts/1/dough.jpg\" alt=\"balls of dough\" width=\"1280\" height=\"836\">If you are like how I used to be, you probably saw some beautiful bread posts online with captions like, “70% bread flour, 30% wheat, 70% hydration, 1.8% salt” and they left you wondering what new version of math equaled up to 171.8%. After much research, nagging many fantastic bakers, and watching more YouTube videos than I can keep track of, I finally figured out the secret to understanding baker’s math and why it’s important.<br><br>Baker’s math, helps you understand the recipes, and let’s you adapt someone else’s recipe to your taste. Simply put, it is the recipe that the baker use to make their bread. Instead of being in cups or grams, it’s measured in percentages. It breaks the bread down into its most basic parts, flour, hydration, salt and starter (There can be more ingredients but we are keeping it simple). This way it allows us to scale up or down a recipe - which will tell us how many grams of an ingredient we will need.<br><br>The key to understanding baker's math lies in the flour. It is of course the most important part of your bread. In baker’s math, flour is always represented as 100%. We can look at the example I mentioned above: 70% bread flour, 30% wheat, 70% hydration, 1.8% salt. You’ll notice there are two types of flour being used, and their percentages add up to 100. If we made a bread that had 4 cups of bread flour, in baker’s math, that would be represented as 100% bread flour. If you had a recipe that called for 200 grams of bread flour, 200grams of rye flour, 200grams of all-purpose flour and 200grams of spelt, those 800 grams would also be represented as 25% bread, 25% rye, 25% all purpose, 25% spelt flour.<br><br>The total weight of all your flour is the starting point for every other percentage in the formula. But for the other percentages to mean anything, you need to determine how much flour you are going to use.</p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image--right\" src=\"https://www.sourdoughbake.com/blog/media/posts/1/water.jpeg\" alt=\"A man pouring water into a glass\" width=\"1280\" height=\"1925\"><br><br>Hydration; typically this just means water. We will talk about other liquids that can be added to breads in a future post. For now let’s just assume that when you see hydration, it means water. In baker’s math, the total amount of water in a recipe is compared to the amount of flour. The simplest example would be if you had half as much water as you do flour, then you would have 50% hydration. I think the sweet spot for new bakers is between 65% and 70% hydration, depending on what kind of bread you are making. Higher hydration doughs are much stickier but can produce larger holes in your bread, or as we call it in the baking world, a larger crumb.<br><br>Let’s take a moment and look at an example. I use about 475 grams of flour to make one loaf of bread. I know I want to make a 75% hydrated loaf. Step one would be to determine that 75% of 475 (grams of flour) is 356 grams of water.<br><br>We will cover the arithmetic below, but assume you want to use 20% of starter in this formula. Still using the same total weight of flour, we now figure out the weight of the starter. 20% of 475 would mean that you would need 95 grams of starter.<br><br>Keep in mind that our starters are made of water and flour. We know that half of that 95 grams of starter is water weight, which needs to be subtracted from the Total Water weight to determine how much water needs to be added when mixing. In this case, to get the total of 356 grams of water, we need to subtract 47 grams of water from the total (since that amount is coming from our starter) which means that 261 grams is the amount of water you need to weigh and add to your dough.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total weight of flour (grams)</strong></td>\n<td><strong>475</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span  >Desired Hydration percentage</span></td>\n<td><span  >78%</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span  >Total Water Weight (gr)</span></td>\n<td><span   >370.5</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span  ><span  >Desired Starter </span></span><span  >percentage</span></td>\n<td><span  >20%</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total Starter (grams)</strong></td>\n<td><strong>95</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span  >Weight of water from starter</span></td>\n<td><span   >47.5</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total Water Needed (total water - starter)</strong></td>\n<td><strong>323</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span  ><span  >Desired Salt </span></span><span  >percentage</span></td>\n<td><span  >2%</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total Salt Needed (grams)</strong></td>\n<td><strong>9.5</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br>Congratulations, you now understand the most “complicated” part of bakers math. All that we have left to cover is starter and salt and those are just additional ingredients calculated based on the total amount of flour. Since we are on the subject, let's talk about our sourdough starter.<br><br>Typically, bakers use a 20% ratio of starter to flour when they bake. If you just did the math in your head to figure out 20% of 475, then you get an A+ for the day.<br><br>20% of 475 grams of flour is 95grams, which is the total starter weight in grams you are going to be adding to your dough.<br><br>Salt is the exact same thing. Typically the amount of salt added into a loaf is between 1.8% and 2.2%. It’s a personal choice you need to make based on your taste preferences and your relationship with salt. Yes, you can bake breads with 1% of salt or less, but they will be fairly bland. Still, at the end of the day, you are the one who will be eating your bread, so use the percentage you are comfortable with. </p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image--left\" src=\"https://www.sourdoughbake.com/blog/media/posts/1/loaf.jpeg\" alt=\"A loaf with different slices\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\"><br><br>There it is folks, baker’s math in a nutshell.

We wanted to take a minute to welcome you, and give you a little bit of information about who we are and what Alexander and I want to do here at Sourdough Bake.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alexander and I met last year on Instagram and bonded over our common love for the art of making sourdough bread. Both of us were fairly new at bread making, but when I needed help getting my starter to spring to life, he was there to help me figure out ways to keep it warm enough to develop. We have been arguing over the best ways to raise our starters and bake our breads ever since.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We both spend our 9-5’s Monday – Friday working in different tech fields. I manage wireless telecom for corporations and Alexander runs a web development company. He also does all the design, development, and back end work on this site, as I’m not allowed to touch anything that I could break. Honestly, that’s a good decision on his part, but don’t tell him I said that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For both of us, making sourdough bread is a way to decompress after a long work day. It’s an opportunity for us to get away from formulas and rigid structures of our jobs and use our hands and senses to create beautiful and delicious bread. We find freedom in the unlimited combinations of grains and techniques that go into our breads.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alexander already had built his Baker’s Percentage Calculator when I came into his world, but it was not long before I was giving him my opinions on how it could be improved and expanded upon (Editor's note: It’s so cute that she believes that). During that conversation, we realized just how many ideas we each had in our heads that the other one could help make real. We decided to partner up and work together to create new bakers tools, recipes, blogs and more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the next few months you will start to see more things happening here at sourdoughbake.com. This new blog Alexander created for us is just the first addition. We can’t wait for you to see what else is coming.</span></p>",
