We wanted to take a minute to welcome you, and give you a little bit of information about who we are and what Alexander and I want to do here at Sourdough Bake.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alexander and I met last year on Instagram and bonded over our common love for the art of making sourdough bread. Both of us were fairly new at bread making, but when I needed help getting my starter to spring to life, he was there to help me figure out ways to keep it warm enough to develop. We have been arguing over the best ways to raise our starters and bake our breads ever since.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We both spend our 9-5’s Monday – Friday working in different tech fields. I manage wireless telecom for corporations and Alexander runs a web development company. He also does all the design, development, and back end work on this site, as I’m not allowed to touch anything that I could break. Honestly, that’s a good decision on his part, but don’t tell him I said that.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For both of us, making sourdough bread is a way to decompress after a long work day. It’s an opportunity for us to get away from formulas and rigid structures of our jobs and use our hands and senses to create beautiful and delicious bread. We find freedom in the unlimited combinations of grains and techniques that go into our breads.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alexander already had built his Baker’s Percentage Calculator when I came into his world, but it was not long before I was giving him my opinions on how it could be improved and expanded upon (Editor's note: It’s so cute that she believes that). During that conversation, we realized just how many ideas we each had in our heads that the other one could help make real. We decided to partner up and work together to create new bakers tools, recipes, blogs and more.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next few months you will start to see more things happening here at sourdoughbake.com. This new blog Alexander created for us is just the first addition. We can’t wait for you to see what else is coming.</span></p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on February 3, 2019</div><div class="post__footer__col"><div class="post__share"></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__next">Next Post<h5><a href="https://www.sourdoughbake.com/blog/bakers-math.html" class="inverse" rel="next">Baker&#x27;s Math</a></h5></div></nav><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://www.sourdoughbake.com/blog/authors/kristen/" class="inverse" title="Kristen">Kristen</a></h3><p>Kristen is a sweet, helpful lady you can find on instagram as @the_dough_eyed_girl</p></div></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii, stitched together by <a href="https://www.talescript.com" title="Websites promote you 24/7.
